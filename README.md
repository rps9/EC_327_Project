In this game you are a knight who got stuck on the moon when he jumped too high. The goal is to jump all the way to the top to escape from the moon and get back home. To control the knight, you want to tilt your phone in the direction you want to go. To jump higher,
angle your phone in an upright position and/or hold down longer on the screen and release when you have charged up the jump height you want. Good luck!
